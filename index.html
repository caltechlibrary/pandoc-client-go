<h1 id="pandoc-client">Pandoc Client</h1>
<p>This repository holds an experimental Go package that functions as a
client to pandoc-server. Caltech Library builds many of it static
websites using Pandoc to render Markdown (and other formats) to HTML (or
other formats). This is typically done via scripting (e.g. Bash, Python)
or a dedicated application (e.g. something written in Go). For a small
number of pages in a slow change website doing an “exec” makes sense.
This approach breaks down when you have a website
(e.g. https://feeds.library.caltech.edu) that has 118545 documents and
is growing.</p>
<h2 id="concept">Concept</h2>
<p>The pandoc server is launched via systemd when the machine starts up.
It listens on a localhost port ONLY. When the site building processes
startup they can read the documents that need to be converted from
either a database (e.g. SQLite3, MySQL, Postgres) or the file system.
That content is then turned into a structure that the Pandoc server
understands and is sent to it as a POST per <a
href="https://pandoc.org/pandoc-server.html">Pandoc Server</a>
documentation. The response then is written to disk (or S3 bucket) as
appropriate.</p>
<p>This should result in a relatively simple Go package and can work
with io.Reader, io.Writer types for maximum flexibility. Combined with
other services we hypothisis is that we would see improved performance
in rendering the website. The expectation is that pandoc-server launches
once, it is a single process (so no overhead on startup). We have the
existing overhead of the data source so that doesn’t change. The
documents are small for the most part so the network overhead between
the client and pandoc-server should be minimal (they are running on the
same machine after all). The write of the rendered document should be
the same as our previous approach. The wind down of the process from the
exec is avoided. We should be able to run conversions in parallel
without worrying about running out of process handles. More parallel
writes should imply that the overall time of the updates can be
lowered.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Go 1.19.2 or better</li>
<li>Pandoc 2.19 or better</li>
<li>A data source (e.g. file system with markdown documents)</li>
<li>A place to write the output (e.g. a file system with render
documents)</li>
</ul>
